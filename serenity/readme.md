# Serenity Project 
`2018 (C) Kiet T. Tran, Ph.D.`

I reworked the examples to show a different approach to automate the executable 
specification using Serenity BDD.

## Credits
For this work, I used these web sites extensively. Much credits
go to the folks who are responsible for the sites:

```

Well, many folks who are working on the open source software that I am using for 
this project.

## Introduction
June 2018: I am using the latest versions of Serenity BDD and many of 
the dependent libraries.

The purpose of this re-implementation is to determine if the new way of writing
the automated tests assists in reading the report.

I want the report to be as readable to the least technical knowledgeable stakeholder.
